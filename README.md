# This is XeroLinux's Nord Rice

-> Some notes before proceeding :

> Applying this rice will override all your settings. So make sure to create a backup of your system either via Snapper if using it, or TimeShift. Don't worry though, script will attempt to create a backup for you of your ~/.config folder before proceeding. Still better be safe than sorry.

# Requirement for *Other* Arch KDE Distros ...

First off, note that if you want to use on other Arch based distros with KDE than **XeroLinux** you will need to add my repo since most of the packages are only available there.

Open the file `/etc/pacman.conf` and add my repo below anywhere :

```
[xerolinux_repo]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = https://xerolinux.github.io/$repo/$arch
```
Save the file, and refresh databases via `sudo pacman -Sy` then follow below step...

# Installation

Just clone this repository, run terminal inside directory and run installer Script will do the following steps :

`git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-nord-git.git && cd xero-nord-git && ./install.sh`

- Create a cbackup of your ~/.config folders
- Download and install necessary packages if needed...
- Override your settings and files with this rice's.
- Install and apply my XeroNord Grub theme.
- Reboot system to get everything loaded... 

# F.A.Q
